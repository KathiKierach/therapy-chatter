# therapyChatter

A Chatter that listens.

I was curious about mental health bots but none of them convinced me.
So I made one on my own.
- the chatters answers are generic, it's pushing random strings from different arrays
- there are buttons to simulate the natural change of a conversation
- there's a randomized delay to the answers just like in a natural conversation
